# Survival Dungeon

Simple game implemented using [cocos2d-x](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x) based on [Masmorra de Dados](https://www.catarse.me/pt/masmorra) board game.

It contains the main gameplay of a modified solo version.

This project was created as a term project for my Information Systems course at [CES/JF](http://www.cesjf.br/).

## Setup

1. Clone this project.
2. Install cocos2d-x.
3. Link or copy cocos2d-x to `./cocos2d`.
4. Run on OSX, iOS or Android.

* Last tested on OSX 10.10.5, XCode 6.4 or 7.0b5 and cocos2d-x 3.8.
* To run on Android the NDK must be correctly configured. (Not tried Android Studio)
* The project is not configured on Windows or Linux, but it should be easy to run on these platforms.
