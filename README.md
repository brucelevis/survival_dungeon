# Survival Dungeon

Simple game implemented using [cocos2d-x](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x) based on [Masmorra de Dados](https://www.catarse.me/pt/masmorra) board game.

It contains the main gameplay of a modified solo version.

This project was created as a term project for my Information Systems course at [CES/JF](http://www.cesjf.br/).
